## üìù Features

- **Paragraph-by-Paragraph Concept Graphs:**  
  - Enter or edit paragraphs and generate directed concept graphs based on sentence similarity and importance.
  - Interactive physics controls (spring length, spring constant, gravity, central gravity) for each paragraph‚Äôs graph.

- **Combined Concept Graph:**  
  - Combine all key nodes from all paragraphs into a single graph.
  - Separate physics controls for the combined graph.
  - Download any graph as an HTML file.

- **Optimal Reading Path:**  
  - Table showing optimal reading sequences based on graph structure.

- **Modern UI:**  
  - Responsive, wide layout with custom CSS.
  - All controls and graphs are always visible and interactive.

- **Dark Theme:**  
  - Clean, dark-themed interface for readability and focus.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Guide

### **1. Enter or Edit Paragraphs**
- In the left column, type or paste your paragraph.
- Click **"Generate Graph"** to visualize the concept graph for that paragraph.
- A node wise Reading Direction will be generated to ease reading.
- Node numbers are displayed in he start of node labels in the graph

### **2. Adjust Physics Controls**
- Use the sliders in the rightmost column to adjust the appearance and layout of the graph:
  - **Spring Length:** Controls the gap between nodes.
  - **Spring Constant:** Adjusts flexibility.
  - **Gravitational Constant:** Controls clustering.
  - **Central Gravity:** Pulls nodes toward the center.

### **3. Add More Paragraphs**
- Click **"Add Paragraph"** to insert another text box and repeat the process.

### **4. Combine Information**
- Click **"Article Covered: Combine Information"** upon entering all paragraph to generate a combined concept graph of all key sentences of the passage.
- Use the left column to adjust physics controls for the combined graph.
- An Article Walkthough in directed graph fashion will be displayed
- Download the combined graph as HTML.

### **5. Explore and Download**
- Interact with the graphs directly in the app.
- Download any graph for offline viewing or sharing.
